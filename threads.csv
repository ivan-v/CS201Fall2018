My opinion of Adrian Flux as  sponsor has slipped, however. Would you as part of a serious car restoration industry want to be associated with this sort of thing?I wondered why they wasted the first part of the programme with the odious Bernie insulting people on the phone and making rude comments about their cars and asking prices.The car 'as found' looked as if it had been decorated to appear rougher than it was, and the whole thing was vaguely reminiscent of the extremely stagey  'Pimp my Ride' series.

","I thought exactly the same, so watched on line   it was dire, the director clearly unsure who his intended audience was.What was annoying is that they really didn't show any restoration, the engine work was glossed over with the statement that ""a piston was fixed"" , the body was taken back to bare metal (not a normal bodgers technique) but we didn't see  how they tackled any of the body faults that must have been present in a 50 year old car   ok there was some tapping down of ""high's"" on the bonnet; staged for the camera, and we saw the filler applied, but was it an inch thick or just a few thou?. I suspect it was the latter as the body blokes turned out what (on the TV) looked pretty good; nice paint equal panel gaps, but the implication was that the body was ""full of filler""Why they made a program that went out of its way to seem to promote bodging; not spent 5 quid on some metal and an hours labour on getting rid of the sunroof, why imply they were fitting secondhand, brake discs, exhaust components and shock's, why stage the phoney crash and make a big deal of surplus oil in the carbs, when they could have at least explained the original misfire...I think it should have been called ""Carry on Restoration"" then at least we could have laughed at it!Dave"
87255,MikeEdwards,,"I watched it last night, on a ""so bad it's good"" basis. Yes, the ""fixed a worn piston"" bit was interesting, just mentioned in passing, in fact I wonder if it was a brake piston and they just didn't mention that to make it sound more complicated. I also thought it might be a bit hard to have painted the inside of the bonnet red without removing either it or the engine, but I don't know E-types that well. I guess there's a chance the PO had done that, as it looked like he had started painting red around it.Would you use an angle grinder with a grinding disc to remove paint on an E-type? I wouldn't. No wonder they roughed the surface of the metal up so much.The crash bit was pathetic. An otherwise empty section of garage, strangely-voiced bloke (Alfa Romero? What's an Alfa Romero?) backs slowly into an engine that has no business being there, and it sticks a big dent in the lower quarter panel? No chance. Hard to see why it was much more than a small scrape in real life.I have trouble believing that second-hand brake disc was going anywhere near the E-type, and I was quite surprised we got as far as the first ad break and they still hadn't bought the car.

If only one or two complaints are received, they won't but if the number of complaints is in the thousands, they will.


From what I've read in this forum and elsewhere, hundreds of people think the series is absolute rubbish yet they're all still watching it and writing about in forum threads rather than complaining to Channel 5 - who must be delighting in all the free publicity! 


Viewing figures will be the only thing C5 will be interested in, as this directly dictates revenue from  advertisers  .  Making a  controversial  program that maintains the viewing numbers certainly wont bother them.
