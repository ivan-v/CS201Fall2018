All parts of this lab are in the lab2_.c file.

Upon running it, for part 3, the program will continue to expect insertions until it recieves a carriage return (^Z on windows).
Upon entering a carriage return, the program will print the list of nodes.
Since a name could potentially have a space (for example, "sallie jones"), but since spaces are not alphanumeric, it will say that spaces are not permitted. Therefore, the entry of "Ins Aunts Sallie Jones" should give the error of having a space in a name, and not "newline expected".
